2.Connected FrontEnd-to-BackEnd.

3.Created a Form which is the First Page of our application which takes all the input. like   School_name,School_city and many more.

4.This Form also lets user Select Image from his/her System.

5 Created Api which used to insert data and Fetch all school data which includes MySql Queries.

6 This also handles multipart/form-data using Multer. beacuse images selection from desktop is FormData and Express.js does not handle it.

7. Some React hooks are also used in managing the state of input feilds of the Form i.e UseState
